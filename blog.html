            <div class="accordion-body"> <span class="fw-bold">Block Scope:</span>  A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope. <br> let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular block. Here let is used for variable which can be changed as we proceed through the program whereas const is used for a variable which doesn’t change till the program ends, that is it remains constant throughout the program. <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Local Scope: </span>In contrast to global variables, locally scoped ones are only visible within the function they are declared. Each function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and every variable declared in this scope is a local variable. That means that variables with the same name can be used in different functions. However, any effort to reference a local variable outside its scope will result in a Reference Error:
